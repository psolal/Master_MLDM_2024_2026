Hello, 

This is a repository for junior MLDM students, I created this repository because the repository from SadilKhan (https://github.com/SadilKhan/MLDM-2020-2022/tree/main) really helped me during my journey !

I will let you have fun discovering everything we did during these two years, exams and exercises.

I hope that it will help you :)
